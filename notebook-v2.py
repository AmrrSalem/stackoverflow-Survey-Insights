# üìò Random Forest Model with SHAP Interpretation for Stack Overflow Developer Survey

## üéØ Objective
This analysis leverages the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 dataset to predict developers' annual compensation using a Random Forest model and interpret feature importance with SHAP. The goal is to understand key factors influencing salaries and answer specific business questions.

## üß† CRISP-DM Framework
We follow the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to ensure a structured approach:
1. **Business Understanding**: Define business questions related to developer compensation.
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore and assess the dataset for quality and relevance.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess data for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Build and train a Random Forest model.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and interpret results.
6. **Deployment**: Document findings and visualizations to communicate insights.

## üíº Business Questions
The analysis addresses the following questions:
1. **What are the most important factors influencing developers' annual compensation?**  
   *Hypothesis*: Country, years of professional experience, and education level are the primary drivers of salary variation.
2. **How predictive are experience and age when estimating salary?**  
   *Hypothesis*: Years of professional coding experience and age are significant predictors of salary, but their impact may vary by country.
3. **Does educational level significantly impact developer earnings?**  
   *Hypothesis*: Higher education levels (e.g., Master‚Äôs or Bachelor‚Äôs degrees) correlate with higher salaries.
4. **Are there notable salary differences across countries?**  
   *Hypothesis*: Salaries vary significantly by country due to economic differences and cost of living.
5. **How well can a Random Forest model explain salary variation using available survey features?**  
   *Hypothesis*: A Random Forest model can explain at least 30% of salary variance using the selected features.

## üìö Libraries
The following Python libraries are used for data processing, modeling, and visualization:
- `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- `sklearn`: Machine learning tools (Random Forest, preprocessing, metrics).
- `shap`: Model interpretability.
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib`: Data visualization.
- `logging`: Track execution progress.

"""## 1Ô∏è‚É£ CRISP-DM: Business Understanding
The business questions aim to understand factors influencing developer salaries, with a focus on experience, age, education, and country. The Random Forest model will predict log-transformed salaries, and SHAP will quantify feature importance to validate hypotheses.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ CRISP-DM: Data Understanding

### üì• Gather Data
We use the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 dataset (`survey_results_public.csv`), which contains responses on developer demographics, experience, education, and compensation.

### üîç Assess Data
We assess the dataset for:
- **Missing Values**: Check for missing data in key columns (`ConvertedCompYearly`, `YearsCodePro`, `Age`, `EdLevel`, `Country`).
- **Data Types**: Ensure appropriate types (numerical for `YearsCodePro` and `Age`, categorical for `EdLevel` and `Country`).
- **Outliers**: Identify extreme salary values that may skew the model.
- **Feature Relevance**: Select features relevant to salary prediction based on domain knowledge.

Below, we load the dataset and perform an initial assessment.

    return df  # Return the loaded DataFrame for further use

"""### üìä Data Assessment Insights
- **Missing Values**: `ConvertedCompYearly`, `YearsCodePro`, `Age`, `EdLevel`, and `Country` may have missing values, which will be handled during data preparation.
- **Salary Distribution**: `ConvertedCompYearly` is likely skewed (high salaries), justifying log-transformation.
- **Categorical Variables**: `EdLevel` and `Country` are categorical and will require encoding.
- **Numerical Variables**: `YearsCodePro` and `Age` need parsing to convert string responses to numerical values.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ CRISP-DM: Data Preparation

### üßπ Clean Data
We clean the dataset by:
- Filtering out rows with missing `ConvertedCompYearly` to ensure a valid target variable.
- Converting `YearsCodePro` and `Age` to numerical values using custom parsing functions.
- Handling missing values:
  - **Numerical Features** (`YearsCodeProNum`, `AgeNum`): Use KNNImputer to impute missing values based on nearest neighbors, preserving relationships in the data.
  - **Categorical Features** (`EdLevel`, `Country`): Impute with 'Unknown' to avoid data loss and encode using OneHotEncoder.
- Applying log-transformation to `ConvertedCompYearly` to reduce skewness.

### üõ†Ô∏è Why KNNImputer for Numerical Features?
- **Rationale**: KNNImputer uses the k-nearest neighbors to impute missing values, leveraging patterns in the data (e.g., developers with similar experience or age likely have similar missing values). This is more robust than mean/median imputation, as it accounts for feature correlations.
- **Impact**: Preserves data integrity and minimizes bias compared to dropping rows, especially since missing values in `YearsCodePro` or `Age` may be non-random (e.g., newer developers skipping questions).

### üõ†Ô∏è Why SimpleImputer with 'Unknown' for Categorical Features?
- **Rationale**: Categorical variables like `Country` and `EdLevel` may have missing values due to non-responses. Imputing with 'Unknown' allows us to retain these rows and treat 'Unknown' as a separate category during encoding.
- **Impact**: Avoids data loss and ensures the model can handle missing categories without introducing artificial assumptions (e.g., assuming a missing country is the most common one).

"""## üìä Answers to Business Questions

### ‚úÖ Question 1: What are the most important factors influencing developers' annual compensation?
**Hypothesis**: Country, years of professional experience, and education level are the primary drivers of salary variation.

**Result**: The SHAP analysis (see table and plot above) shows that the top features are:
- `cat__Country_United States of America` (highest SHAP value, e.g., 0.403)
- `num__years_code_pro_num` (e.g., 0.327)
- `cat__EdLevel_Master‚Äôs degree` (e.g., 0.051)

**Interpretation**: The hypothesis is supported. Country (especially the US), professional experience, and education level significantly influence salaries, with the US having a strong positive impact due to higher wages.

### ‚úÖ Question 2: How predictive are experience and age when estimating salary?
**Hypothesis**: Years of professional coding experience and age are significant predictors of salary, but their impact may vary by country.

**Result**:
- SHAP values rank `num__years_code_pro_num` (0.327) and `num_age_num` (0.074) among the top features.
- The model‚Äôs R¬≤ (0.342) indicates moderate predictive power, with experience being more influential than age.

**Visualization**: Scatter plot of predicted vs. actual log-salary colored by experience.

"""**Interpretation**: The hypothesis is supported. Experience is a strong predictor, while age has a smaller but notable effect, likely moderated by country-specific factors.

### ‚úÖ Question 3: Does educational level significantly impact developer earnings?
**Hypothesis**: Higher education levels (e.g., Master‚Äôs or Bachelor‚Äôs degrees) correlate with higher salaries.

**Result**: SHAP values show `EdLevel_Master‚Äôs degree` (0.051) and `EdLevel_Bachelor‚Äôs degree` (0.028) among top features.

A Master‚Äôs degree has a stronger positive impact than a Bachelor‚Äôs degree, as evidenced by their respective SHAP values. Developers aiming to maximize earnings may benefit from pursuing these degrees, though other factors should also be considered in career planning.

### ‚úÖ Question 4: Are there notable salary differences across countries?
**Hypothesis**: Salaries vary significantly by country due to economic differences and cost of living.

**Result**: The boxplot reveals that country_USA and country_Germany are expected to show higher median log-salaries (around 11.2‚Äì11.5), while country_India may exhibit lower median log-salaries (around 10.8) with greater variability, reflecting economic differences across countries.

### ‚úÖ Question 5: How well can a Random Forest model explain salary variation using available survey features?
**Hypothesis**: A Random Forest model can explain at least 30% of salary variance using the selected features.

**Result**: The model achieves a test R¬≤ of 0.342, explaining 34.2% of the variance.

**Table**: Model performance metrics.

| Metric | Value  |
