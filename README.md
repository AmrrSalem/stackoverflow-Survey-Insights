# üß† Developer Salary Prediction Using Stack Overflow Survey 2024

This repository presents a machine learning pipeline for predicting developer salaries using the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. It uses a Random Forest model and SHAP values to explain feature importance.

## üìå Motivation

The aim of this project is to:
- Predict developer salaries using experience, education, age, and country.
- Identify the most impactful features that influence compensation.
- Provide interpretable results using SHAP values.

## üìà Summary of Results

- The Random Forest model achieves solid R¬≤ = {0.34} scores in cross-validation and test evaluation.
- SHAP analysis indicates that **Country**, **Years of Professional Coding Experience**, and **Education Level** are the top predictors of salary.
- The notebook answers 5 business questions related to salary prediction and feature importance.
- Medium's blog post provides a concise version of the results and findings. https://medium.com/@amrr.salem/developer-salaries-why-location-matters-more-than-you-think-cf38b6796014
